# Flyimg
Truly responsive images, on the fly.

#### Step 1:

In all images, replace `src` with `data-src`.

#### Step 2:

Include the script and initiate image flying:

    <script src="flyimg.js"></script>
    <script>flyimg.flyAll();</script>


#### Step 3:

There is no step 3. There are only 2 steps.
